- [ ] Build a standard dashboard where users can go in and check out how their employees answered and a translation to plain English of what it means. 
- [ ] Managers then get a whole report with charts and all the answers with a company wide summary. 
- [ ] How do we track that users are getting the emails for recommendations/experiments to improve traits? 
- [ ] Maybe have an agent that they chat with, they have the context and the answers for the user and can see what worked and what didn’t. 
- [ ] 360, self assessment, company assessment. What do we do with that information? What are we looking at in terms of recommendations? 
- [ ] Build the UI with Hexaco questionnaire, create the login
- [ ] Show the admin dashboards where the managers will get access to the the responses from the users. 
- [ ] We want to preserve anonymity, there has been an issue with senior people not doing 360s.  We need to track who has done, binary true or false. 
- [ ] Link sent out, track the link. How do we send out these links? Each email? Automate the link generation for each 360 and send through resend. We can then store the email and info in our db, but we don’t share the email to the admins etc.
- [ ] Now they are using Lattice, they fill out four different forms, Dessy exports the type forms/pdfs of each report, it goes to their managers and their managers take the 360 and any bottom, put it together. We give them a template for recommendations for one and for another, what they’re going to do in 2026 (promotions, etc), then they get a report with word docs etc for each and then they’re told their bonuses etc. No central repo where this all exists, people could login to Lattice to see it, but no one does. Yes, they get the PDFs that is forgotten about it. HE would have the ability to store this information and refer to it at least twice a year to see how people are tracking and seeing the measurements of how they’re tracking. We can send queries to direct report to see how they’re tracking. Where are they, where do they need to go, easy access for topline to se what you need to work on. Eventually we have something (llm) that they can ask for recommendations to hit their goals and then we can have educational content to help them grow and hit their goals.
